# tak-bot
 the home of ManicBot

ManicBot is an implementation of the Negamax algorithm with alpha/beta pruning, designed to play Tak. (a game designed by James Earnest, dreamed up by Patrick Rothfuss)

As of right now, the bot is under active development by dayofni, so expect this space to change.

Dependencies: `websockets` and `requests` for internet access. Otherwise, all code is written in Python by dayofni.
