# Bugs so far

1. TPS import / export, please for the love of god
2. Working 2-ply heuristic bot

# To do

1. Set up PTN export for moves because omg it's getting annoying.
2. Design engine and functionality.
   -> Code based - I can edit parameters in code tyvm
   -> Full PTN file import/export
   -> Generate ptn.ninja links?

# Bot plans and ideas

1. Upper-level beginner bot (~1600 elo) -> "FortuneBot"
   -> Quiescence search so that it doesn't miss capture sequences leading to Tinue
   -> Not a great heuristic, so that it's not stupid strong
   -> Beginner level opening book to get it out of huge strife

2. Intermediate bot (~1800 elo) -> "ManicBot"
   -> FortuneBot with a good heuristic
   -> Likes to be an asshole
